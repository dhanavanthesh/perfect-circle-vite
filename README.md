## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Changing the Neon Colors

Edit colors in component styles:
```jsx
// Primary neon cyan
'#00ffff'

// Secondary neon magenta  
'#ff00ff'

// Accent neon yellow
'#ffff00'

// Background dark
'#0a0a0a'
```

### Adjusting Canvas Size

Update dimensions in src/pages/Home.jsx:
```jsx
const canvasWidth = 600;   // Change width
const canvasHeight = 600;  // Change height
```

### Modifying Scoring Algorithm

Adjust scoring weights in the calculateCircleScore function:
```jsx
// Current weights
const finalScore = (
  consistencyScore * 0.6 +  // 60% consistency
  closureScore * 0.3 +      // 30% closure
  sizeScore * 0.1           // 10% size
);
```

### Adding New Themes

Create new color schemes in CSS variables:
```css
:root {
  --neon-primary: #00ffff;
  --neon-secondary: #ff00ff;
  --background: #0a0a0a;
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start**:
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 16.0+

# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Canvas not responsive**:
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for errors

**Fonts not loading**:
- Check internet connection for Google Fonts
- Fonts automatically fallback to system defaults

**Performance issues**:
- Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Close other browser tabs for better performance
- Clear browser cache if needed

### Development Tips

**Hot Reload Issues**:
```bash
# Restart the dev server
npm run dev
```

**Build Problems**:
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Perfect Circles

- **Start Slow**: Begin drawing at a comfortable, controlled pace
- **Use Your Whole Arm**: Don't just move your wrist - use your entire arm for smoother motion
- **Focus on Center**: Keep consistent distance from an imaginary center point
- **Practice the Motion**: Hover over the canvas and practice the circular motion before drawing
- **Close the Loop**: Make sure your starting and ending points connect smoothly
- **Steady Breathing**: Stay relaxed and maintain steady breathing while drawing
- **Multiple Attempts**: Each attempt teaches you something new about your drawing technique

## 📊 Algorithm Details

The circle perfection algorithm evaluates three key metrics:

**Consistency Score (60% weight)**:
- Measures how uniform the radius is throughout the circle
- Calculates standard deviation of distances from center
- Lower deviation = higher consistency score

**Closure Score (30% weight)**:
- Evaluates how well start and end points connect
- Measures distance between first and last drawn points
- Smaller gap = higher closure score

**Size Score (10% weight)**:
- Ensures circle is large enough for accurate measurement
- Minimum radius threshold for optimal scoring
- Prevents tiny circles from getting perfect scores
